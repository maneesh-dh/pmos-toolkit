# `state.yaml` schema (`/feature-sdlc`)

Single source of truth for the resumable pipeline state file written at `<worktree>/.pmos/feature-sdlc/state.yaml`. SKILL.md prose cites this document rather than redeclaring fields. Companion: `pipeline-status-template.md` (the rendered Markdown view of this same data).

---

## schema_version

`schema_version: 2` is the current version. Files written by /feature-sdlc < 2.34.0 carry `schema_version: 1` and are auto-migrated on read (see "Schema v2 migration" below).

**Migration policy** (per FR-SCHEMA / spec §15 G3):

- `state.schema_version > current code's max supported` → abort with: `state file from newer /feature-sdlc version (vN); upgrade pmos-toolkit and retry`.
- `state.schema_version < current code's max` → auto-migrate by default-filling additive fields; log every migration to chat as `migration: state.schema vM → vN (added: <fields>)`.
- Same version → no migration.

Pipeline runs are short-lived (days, not years) so destructive migrations are not anticipated; if ever needed, bump the major schema number and refuse-not-migrate from that boundary.

## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `schema_version` | int | yes | Always 1 in v1. |
| `slug` | string | yes | LLM-derived kebab-case identifier (per `slug-derivation.md`). |
| `tier` | int (1\|2\|3) \| null | yes | Set when known (either `--tier` flag or after `/requirements` Phase 3 auto-tier). `null` until then. |
| `mode` | string | yes | `interactive` or `non-interactive`. Resolved per the canonical non-interactive block at Phase 0. |
| `started_at` | string (ISO-8601) | yes | First creation timestamp. Never updated. |
| `last_updated` | string (ISO-8601) | yes | Updated on every status change. |
| `current_phase` | string | yes | The phase id currently being executed or the most recent paused/failed one. Matches one of the `phases[].id` values below. |
| `worktree_path` | string (abs path) \| null | yes | Absolute path of the worktree directory. `null` only when `--no-worktree` was passed. |
| `branch` | string \| null | yes | Branch name (typically `feat/<slug>`). `null` only when `--no-worktree`. |
| `feature_folder` | string (abs path) | yes | Resolved per `_shared/pipeline-setup.md` Section A — `<docs_path>/features/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>/`. Child skills' artifacts land here. |
| `phases` | list | yes | One entry per pipeline phase, in declared order. See below. |
| `open_questions_log` | list | yes | Initialized `[]`. Appended to in `--non-interactive` mode after each child phase. See entry shape below. |

## `phases[]` entries

Every entry has at minimum:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Phase identifier — one of the values listed under "Phase identifiers + hardness" below. |
| `hardness` | string | `hard`, `soft`, or `infra`. Drives failure-dialog construction (see `failure-dialog.md`). |
| `status` | string | One of the values listed under "Status enum" below. |
| `artifact_path` | string (rel path) \| null | Path of the canonical artifact this phase produced (relative to `feature_folder`). `null` when no artifact (e.g., phase `setup`, phase `compact-checkpoint`). |
| `started_at` | string (ISO-8601) \| null | When `status` first became `in_progress`. |
| `completed_at` | string (ISO-8601) \| null | When `status` became `completed`. |
| `paused_at` | string (ISO-8601) \| null | When `status` became `paused` (per FR-PAUSE / spec §15 G1). |
| `paused_reason` | string \| null | Why paused. See enum below. |
| `last_error` | string \| null | One-line error captured on failure-pause. |
| `child_tier` | int \| null | Child-skill auto-tier when it differs from the orchestrator tier (per spec §15 G8). |
| `child_tier_divergence` | string \| null | Free-form note when child reports a different tier. |
| `missing_skill` | string \| null | Set when `paused_reason: missing_skill` — names the missing child skill. |
| `folded_phase_failures` | list | (v2) Append-only list of folded-skill failure records — `{folded_skill, error_excerpt, ts}`. Empty `[]` until a folded child crashes. See "Schema v2" below for dedup rule. |

### Phase identifiers + hardness

In declared execution order (matches spec §5):

- `setup` — **infra** (always run; no failure dialog beyond pipeline-setup's own).
- `worktree` — **infra** (worktree creation; G7 dialog handled inline).
- `init-state` — **infra** (write state.yaml + 00_pipeline.md).
- `requirements` — **hard** (Skip option HIDDEN in failure dialog).
- `grill` — **soft** (Skip option SHOWN; also auto-skipped in `--non-interactive` per FR-TIER-SCOPE / spec §15 G8).
- `msf-req` — **soft**.
- `creativity` — **soft**.
- `wireframes` — **soft**.
- `prototype` — **soft**.
- `spec` — **hard**.
- `simulate-spec` — **soft**.
- `plan` — **hard**.
- `execute` — **hard**.
- `verify` — **hard**.
- `complete-dev` — **hard**.
- `retro` — **soft** (v2; gate per FR-34 with `Recommended=Skip`).
- `final-summary` — **infra**.
- `capture-learnings` — **infra**.

The compact checkpoint (`compact-checkpoint.md`) is a recurring micro-phase, not a `phases[]` entry — it is invoked before phases `wireframes`, `prototype`, `simulate-spec`, `execute`, `verify` and writes its pause record into the *next* phase's entry (see `compact-checkpoint.md`).

### Status enum

- `pending` — declared but not started.
- `in_progress` — currently executing.
- `completed` — finished cleanly (child skill returned success).
- `paused` — exited cleanly mid-phase per FR-PAUSE; resumable via `--resume`.
- `failed` — errored; failure dialog will be re-presented on `--resume`.
- `skipped` — user picked Skip at the gate (soft phases only) or `--non-interactive` auto-recommendation chose Skip.
- `skipped-on-failure` — user picked Skip in the failure dialog after an error (soft phases only).
- `skipped-non-interactive` — explicit auto-skip in non-interactive mode (`grill` when `mode == non-interactive`).
- `skipped-unavailable` — child skill not installed and user (or `--non-interactive` auto-pick) chose Skip in the missing-skill dialog (soft phases only).

### `paused_reason` enum

- `compact` — user chose Pause-resumable at a compact checkpoint.
- `failure` — user chose Pause-resumable in a failure dialog.
- `user` — user chose Pause-resumable outside a dialog (e.g., interrupted between phases).
- `missing_skill` — user chose Pause-to-install in the missing-skill dialog (per FR-MISSING-SKILL / spec §15 G10). `missing_skill` field captures the child skill name.

## `open_questions_log[]` entry shape

Per FR-OQ-INDEX / spec §15 G4. Append-only; written after each `--non-interactive` child phase that flushed deferred questions.

```yaml
- phase: <phase id>
  child_skill: <e.g., requirements, spec, plan>
  oq_artifact_path: <relative path under feature_folder, e.g., 01_requirements.md or _open_questions.md>
  deferred_count: <int, count of DEFER classifications by the child>
  ts: <ISO-8601 when the entry was appended>
```

At end-of-run AND end-of-pause, `/feature-sdlc` writes `<feature_folder>/00_open_questions_index.md` summarizing every entry in this log with links to each child's OQ artifact.

---

## Schema v2 (added 2026-05-10)

v2 is additive over v1 — no field removals, no rename, no reshape. v1 files are auto-migrated to v2 on read.

### What's new in v2

1. **`phases[].folded_phase_failures: []`** — empty list initialized on every phase entry. Appended to by parent skills (`/requirements`, `/wireframes`, `/spec`) when a folded child phase (msf-req, msf-wf, simulate-spec) crashes. Each entry: `{folded_skill: <name>, error_excerpt: <first-200-chars>, ts: <ISO-8601>}`.
2. **`phases[].started_at`** — timestamp written on the first `pending → in_progress` transition (FR-57). Already documented in v1 phase entries; v2 makes the write contract explicit (only set if currently null; never overwritten).
3. **`phases[]` includes `retro`** entry — appended after `complete-dev`, before `final-summary`.

### `folded_phase_failures[]` append-dedup rule

When appending a new failure record, compare against existing entries in the same `folded_phase_failures[]` list. If an entry exists with **identical `folded_skill`** AND **identical `error_excerpt`** (byte-for-byte), do NOT append a duplicate; update the existing entry's `ts` to the new timestamp instead. This keeps the list bounded under repeated /resume retries.

### v1 → v2 auto-migration block (4 steps, idempotent)

Performed on read whenever `state.schema_version < 2`:

1. **Set `schema_version: 2`.**
2. **Ensure `folded_phase_failures: []` is present on every `phases[]` entry.** Default to empty list if absent. Same for `started_at: null` on entries that lack the field.
3. **Append the `retro` phase entry** between `complete-dev` and `final-summary` if not already present. Default: `{id: retro, hardness: soft, status: pending, artifact_path: null}`.
4. **Emit chat log line:** `migration: state.schema v1 → v2 (added: folded_phase_failures, started_at on N entries, retro phase)`.

### Atomicity (D31)

State writes use **same-directory write-temp-then-rename**: write to `<state.yaml>.tmp` in `.pmos/feature-sdlc/`, then `rename(2)` to `state.yaml` (POSIX atomic on same filesystem). On rename(2) failure, the `.tmp` file is removed and the operation is reported as a hard error per NFR-08 — never leave a `.tmp` orphan that a future run could mistake for in-progress state. /plan startup runs a stale-tempfile reaper.

## Worked example (Tier-3 mid-pipeline pause)

Captures every field for an `--resume`-ready pause. The pipeline ran cleanly through `requirements` and `grill`, paused at the compact checkpoint before `wireframes`.
